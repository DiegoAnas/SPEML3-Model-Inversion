# SPEML3-Model-Inversion
Todo: 
  * Understand what TensorFlow is doing
  * Try to make pylearn2 work
  * If not, find some ZCA and GCA implementation we can use
  * Understand why ZCA and GCA are used
 If it works, which I guess it should:
  * Add other models like in the original paper
  * Add some image manipulation operations like it mentions in the paper (but they don't implement??)
